This is a small project that was required as part of the Digital Cloud Academy section on Infrastructure as Code. 
The cloudformation template deploys a VPC, EC2 instance and RDS database. The EC2 instance will run a Python script (supplied) that connects to RDS and creates/retrieves a record.

Since it's just one template, it can be run from the console and there is no efficiency gain from working form the CLI.
